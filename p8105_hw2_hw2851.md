## Problem 1

``` r
trash_wheel_data_set = './data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx'
mr_trash_wheel_data = read_excel(trash_wheel_data_set) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # remove columns containing notes
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>%
  # remove rows that don't contain dumpster-specific data (for example, "May Total")
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(month, "Total")) %>%
  # round the number of sports balls
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```

The Mr.Â trash wheel dataset has 344 rows. After clean up, it contains 14
columns: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered. Here is the first
row of the dataset: 1, May, 2014, 2014-05-16, 4.31, 18, 1450, 1820,
1.26^{5}, 72, 584, 1162, 7, 0. Here is the last row of the dataset: 344,
June, 2019, 2019-06-17, 3.02, 15, 3300, 2400, 8000, 18, 500, 1600, 16,
50.3333333. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is
8.5.

``` r
precipitation_2019_data = read_excel(trash_wheel_data_set, sheet="2019 Precipitation", skip=1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(year = "2019")

precipitation_2018_data = read_excel(trash_wheel_data_set, sheet="2018 Precipitation", skip=1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_data = bind_rows(precipitation_2019_data, precipitation_2018_data) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The 2018 and 2019 combined precipitation dataset has 18 rows. After
clean up, it contains 3 columns: month, total, year. Here is the first
row of the dataset: January, 3.1, 2019. Here is the last row of the
dataset: December, 6.11, 2018. The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33.
